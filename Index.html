                        <p class="description"> This Map shows results aquired using <a href="https://github.com/taetscher/ICARUS" target="_blank">ICARUS</a>. It is currently a work in progress, hence why the zooming and panning action is still laggy as it can be. Also, please keep in mind that on this map, all of the predictions are shown - while you really can't take any prediction below a confidence of 0.85 too seriously.<br/><br/>
                            
                        ICARUS is an image classification algorithm which detects asphalt roads in images. Please read a more detailed description over at <a href="https://taetscher.github.io/ICARUS/" target="_blank">ICARUS' standalone website</a>. <br/><br/>

                        <h3>ABSTRACT</h3>
                        
                        <p> With the emergence of the Internet of Things (IoT) and the extensive amount of
                            data produced by it, science's desire to investigate this vast amount of untapped
                            data is growing, resulting in the paradigm of big data: data sets of exceedingly large
                            volumes, growing at exceptional rates, consisting of enormous amounts of structured
                            and unstructured data. At the same time, artifcial intelligence (AI) techniques
                            needed to analyze data sets of these proportions continue to improve.
                            The potentials attributed to big data analyses are extensive, particularly in the
                            context of efficiently generating reliable, up-to-date data to measure progress towards
                            the Agenda 2030's Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, many scientific
                            contributions in this domain, focusing on unexploited capacities, rely on future
                            technological progress and therefore project prospective potentials. Yet, the SDGs
                            were designed to tackle current global challenges.
                            For some of the indicators of sustainability introduced with the SDGs, it is still
                            unclear how reliable data can efficiently be generated. Therefore, this study examines
                            current technological capabilities and their potential contribution to overcoming a
                            lack of data. It does so with an example of a big data analysis: applying an image
                            classification algorithm (deep neural network) to geolocated media content posted to
                            Twitter, in order to both illustrate the current potentials of such an approach, as well
                            as challenges left to overcome if big data is to be used to generate useful information
                            for measuring progress towards the SDGs.
                            The findings of this study show that current technological capabilities already
                            facilitate real-time analyses of big data from social media on a global scale. Yet, biases
                            within the data, resulting from uncertainties regarding the accuracy of geolocated
                            social media posts, along with low internet penetration rates and a consequent lack
                            of data - coupled with an unavailability of data from prime sources like Facebook
                            and Instagram - render such analyses incomplete, thus diminishing the significance of
                            information gained this way.
                            Better access to more data from diverse sources is needed to improve on our
                            current capacities to generate reliable data to monitor progress towards improving
                            sustainability. However, especially analyses of data from social media are embedded in
                            a debate over privacy and data protection. This debate is here to stay. Nevertheless,
                            some of the reservations against artificial intelligence and big data analyses can be
                            alleviated by a high degree of transparency (i.e. by making big data projects open
                            source).</p>
